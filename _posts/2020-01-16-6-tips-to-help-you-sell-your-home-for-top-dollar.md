Before you list your home for sale, be sure you follow these six key tips in order to maximize the outcome:

**1\. Meet with your agent.** Your agent will provide you with updates on the market, your neighborhood, and home prices. This will give you some guidance on what to do and what not to do before you list your home.

**2\. Talk to a lender.** You need to make sure that you qualify for a move-up property so that you know exactly how much you’ll net.

**3\. Price your house correctly.** If you price your home according to its market value, you won’t have any reservations about how long it will take to sell.

**4\. Declutter your home.** Don’t leave a bunch of stuff laying around the house. Clean up your clutter so that your buyers can see the size, color, and brightness of the property.

**5\. Do a pre-inspection.** This will help you to determine the property’s current condition and potentially fix any issues that would come up when a buyer has an inspection done. Pre-inspections are a proactive way to clean up the process and further entice your buyers.

**6\. Use professional photography.** First impressions are important\! Make sure your listing photos are clear and bright. This is especially important in today’s market, where most people begin their home searches online. If they don’t like the photos you put on your listing, they may not even come to view your home.
