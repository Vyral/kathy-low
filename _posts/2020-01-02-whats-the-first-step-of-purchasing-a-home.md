The first step you need to take in order to purchase a home is talk to a mortgage lender. They will be able to help guide you through the process of getting approved for a loan amount. Once you find out what you qualify for, it helps you and your agent know exactly what you can afford. Then you can start making a plan with your agent for your home search.
